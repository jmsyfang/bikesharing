# bikesharing


## Intro
We are exploring the option of adding a bikeshare program to Des Moines, using NYC data for data exploration. We will explore the usage of bikes by gender and date, but will have to explore the differences between the two cities to get a better idea of how customers may use our bikes differently.

## Summary
Looking at usage charts, we can see males use the bike share program more than females. They use bikes for a longer duration, and usually start checking out bikes around work start and end. This is expected given how most users are also subscribers, suggesting they use citibikes to commute to work. We should look into implementing the same idea in Des Moines, but the city density is much different and may not be as attractive compared to automotive alternatives. Regardless, it is a strong entry point and provides an opportunity for us to market towards professional women as well.
